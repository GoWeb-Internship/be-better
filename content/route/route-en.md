<ul>
    <li>You don't live the way you dream</li>
    <li>You experience fear or anxiety and there is only negativity around (you do not see gaps)</li>
    <li>Lost concentration, trying to cover everything at once, but not getting the desired result</li>
    <li>You don’t understand what you want and whether these are your desires, you don’t know what to do next</li>
    <li>You don't want to work or do something, but you have to</li>
    <li>Do you want to do something that brings pleasure and income</li>
    <li>You understand that the new day is similar to the previous one, stuck in the “groundhog day”</li>
</ul>
