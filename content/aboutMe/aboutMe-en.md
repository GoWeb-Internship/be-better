<p>Hello, I'm Yuliya and my motto is - to live it up! I always do what
brings me pleasure and fun, I like to discover new cities, countries, continents and I can’t stop doing it.
</p>

<p>For more than<span> 7 years</span>I have been helping start-up companies to develop and optimize their business.</p>

<p>My goal is to make this world a little better and increase the number of 
<span>conscious happy people.</span> That’s why, since 2021, I decided to devote myself to coaching and use all my experience to help those who are lost and can’t see any prospects or don’t know where to start.</p>

<p>Together we will reveal your potential, analyze your desires and determine what slows down you along the way to your goals.</p>
<p><span>And you will definitely get to know what it is to live it up!</span></p>
